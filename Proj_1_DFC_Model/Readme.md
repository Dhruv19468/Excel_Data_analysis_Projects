# Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Modeling Project

## Project Intro
This Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Modeling project aims to assess a company's financial value through free cash flow projections, discounted to present value, and terminal value calculations. The objective is to determine the company's overall valuation by calculating the present value of future cash flows and its worth at a future point, factoring in key financial metrics.

## Overview
- **Dataset**: The dataset includes the company's Income Statement, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow Statement.
- **Tools**: Excel for financial modeling and analysis.
- **Objective**: Estimate the company's future worth by discounting future free cash flows and terminal value using the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC).

## Steps Involved
1. **Cash Flow Projections**:
   - Forecast free cash flows by developing revenue projections.
   - Prepare schedules for fixed assets and net working capital to estimate future cash flows.
   
2. **WACC Calculation**:
   - Compute the Weighted Average Cost of Capital, which will be used to discount future cash flows to their present value.

3. **Terminal Value Calculation**:
   - Estimate the company's terminal value, representing the future worth beyond the forecast period.

4. **Enterprise Value Calculation**:
   - Discount both the projected free cash flows and terminal value to their present value, and calculate the company's overall valuation.

## Financial Questions to Answer
- **Asset Composition**: Factors influencing the company's current assets vs long-term assets.
- **Debt-to-Equity Ratio**: Impact on creditworthiness, changes over time, and the reliance on debt vs equity.
- **Revenue Growth**: Analyzing growth over three years and identifying the segments driving this growth.
- **Gross Margin**: Calculation and comparison over the three years, evaluating the company's ability to maintain or improve margins.
- **Free Cash Flow Analysis**: How investors can use free cash flow analysis to compare companies within the same industry.

## Tools Used
- Excel for modeling and analysis
- Financial formulas (WACC, free cash flows, terminal value)
